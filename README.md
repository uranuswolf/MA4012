# MA4012 Group 5

motor speed: 
127 → Full speed forward
0 → Stop
-127 → Full speed reverse
This applies to both VEX 393 motors and VEX Continuous Rotation motors.

To move forward, all wheels must rotate ACW
Hence motor should rotate CW
Left motor rotate cw , from the LSV
When mirror ,
right motor rotate acw, from the lSV
hence put negative right motor speed
